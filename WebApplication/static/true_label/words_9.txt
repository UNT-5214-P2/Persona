 have a perfectly normal ability at distance things So the typical task is subdivision So there
 a a line on the wall over there and you give them a laser pointer and you say Where the midpoint
 And they do fine If you give them the line and they have to touch it they can't There just that
 part of the brain isn't functioning so they can't do that Here the real experiment The same
 thing on the wall you give them a laser where is it they do it Mm Give hmm them a stick long
 stick and say do it they can't do it So there a remapping of distant space into nearby Right
 space So they doubled Because it within the the reach end now the end It of not Yeah within
