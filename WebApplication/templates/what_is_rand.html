            Rand index adjusted for chance.
            <br />
            The Rand Index computes a similarity measure between two clusterings by considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and true clusterings.
            <br />
            The raw RI score is then “adjusted for chance” into the ARI score using the following scheme:
        </p>
        <pre>ARI = (RI - Expected_RI) / (max(RI) - Expected_RI)</pre>
        <p>
            The adjusted Rand index is thus ensured to have a value close to 0.0 for random labeling independently of the number of clusters and samples and exactly 1.0 when the clusterings are identical (up to a permutation).
            <br />
            ARI is a symmetric measure:
        </p>
        <pre>adjusted_rand_score(a, b) == adjusted_rand_score(b, a)</pre>
